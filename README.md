## Documentation: bKash Payment Page

### 1. Overview

This document describes the use and setup of a standalone bKash payment confirmation page. The primary purpose of this page is to collect a Transaction ID (TrxID) from a user after they have completed a payment via the bKash "Send Money" feature.

This is **not an automated payment gateway**. It is a manual verification system where the user sends money to a specified number and then submits the transaction details through this form. The submitted details are then sent to your email for manual confirmation.

### 2. Key Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring it looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
*   **Dark Mode Support:** The UI automatically adapts to the user's system preference for light or dark mode.
*   **Backend-less Form Handling:** Uses the `formsubmit.co` service to process form submissions and send the data directly to your email without needing a custom backend.
*   **User-Friendly:** Provides clear, step-by-step instructions and a "Copy" button for the payment number.
*   **Copy-to-Clipboard:** A one-click button allows users to copy the recipient's bKash number, reducing the chance of errors.
*   **Easy to Customize:** Can be easily modified with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

### 3. How It Works

The process is divided into two parts: the user's actions and the backend process.

**1. User Flow:**
*   The user visits the page and sees the payment amount and instructions.
*   They click the "Copy" button to copy the recipient bKash number.
*   Using their bKash App or by dialing the USSD code (*247#), they "Send Money" to the copied number.
*   After the transaction is successful, they receive a Transaction ID (TrxID) from bKash.
*   They return to the page, enter this TrxID into the input field, and click the "Confirm" button.

**2. Backend Flow (`formsubmit.co`):**
*   Upon form submission, the data is sent to `formsubmit.co`'s servers.
*   `formsubmit.co` formats this data into a table and sends it to your pre-configured email address.
*   It can also send an automated "Thank You" email to the user (if configured).
*   Finally, the user is redirected to the "Thank You" page you specified.

### 4. Setup and Configuration

To use this payment page, you only need to modify a few key parts of the HTML file.

**Step 1: Set Your Email Address**

Set the email address where you want to receive the form submissions. Change the `action` attribute in the `<form>` tag.

```html
<!-- Change the email in this line -->
<form action="https://formsubmit.co/your-email@example.com" method="POST" class="p-6">
```

**Step 2: Set the "Thank You" Page URL**

Define the page where users will be redirected after a successful submission. Change the `value` of the `_next` input field.

```html
<!-- Change the URL for your "Thank You" page here -->
<input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://your-website.com/thank-you.html">
```

**Step 3: Update the bKash Number**

Change the placeholder number to the actual bKash number where you will receive payments.

```html
<!-- Change your bKash number here -->
<span id="payment-number" class="font-bold tracking-wider text-base">01XXXXXXXXX</span>
```

**Step 4: Update the Payment Amount**

The payment amount needs to be updated in three places: once for display, once in a hidden field for data submission, and once in the instructions.

```html
<!-- 1. For display -->
<div class="flex justify-between ...">
    ...
    <span class="text-gray-900 dark:text-white font-bold text-lg">Tk 500</span> <!-- Change amount here -->
</div>

...

<!-- 2. For form data (Hidden Field) -->
<input type="hidden" name="Amount" value="Tk 500"> <!-- Change amount here -->

...

<!-- 3. In the instructions list -->
<li><span class="mr-2">â€¢</span>Amount: <span class="font-bold">500</span></li> <!-- Change amount here -->
```

### 5. Customization

*   **Changing Colors:** The primary color is `bg-pink-600`. You can change this and other colors using Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `bg-blue-600`, `hover:bg-blue-700`).
*   **Changing Text:** All text for headers, instructions, or buttons can be edited directly in the HTML file.
*   **Adding More Form Fields:** If you need to collect more information, such as the user's name or email, you can add new input fields to the form.

    ```html
    <!-- Example: Add a field for the user's name -->
    <div class="mb-4">
        <label for="name" class="block text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">Your Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="User_Name" class="w-full p-3 rounded-md ..." required>
    </div>
    ```

### 6. Limitations

*   **Manual Verification:** This is not an automated system. You must manually check the TrxID received in your email against your bKash account statement to verify each payment.
*   **Security:** `formsubmit.co` is a third-party service. Review their privacy policy before using it for highly sensitive data.
*   **Incorrect TrxID:** Users can mistype or submit an incorrect Transaction ID. Verification is essential to confirm payment.
